 want the xcode project (WedgeIosApp) to interact with an api. For local dev i want it to interact with local host. On commit to staging i want it to build to test flight and that version of the app uses the stagiing api. Then on commit to main, publish to the app store and it uses prod api. For the backend api. I want cicd to do the following. On commit to staging - build and run fast api (python) on cloud run (wedge-staging-api). The actual url should be stored / given to xcode. Same with prod. For the backend the api should use firestore database. If its main use prod (sub collection), if staging use staging sub collection. Then if on local dev (whatever the branch name is created) create a subcollection to allow for independent dev usage.
